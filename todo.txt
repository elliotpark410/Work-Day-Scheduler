Pseudocode:
Display current day at top of calendar with moment.js
    -create variable with hours for timeblock as an array 
    -create variables for currentDate and currentHour = moment(.date)
    -Create a h1 with id="currentDate" in html and create an h1.innerHTML or h1.textContent in JavaScript 
With bootstrap, create a timeblock with an input field for hours 6am - 11pm (development) / 8am - 6pm (production)
    -Create a CSS table (3 columns and rows for number of hours)
    -display time to user with am and pm, but use military time for JS logic
    -create a div with an id for each row (i.e. each hour, input field, and save)
Create a save button to persist input field to local storage
    -create click event listener for save button which runs a function that will get the element.values in the input field and save to local storage
    -create get local storage to fetch input that was saved with the input's id and display it with input.innerhtml
    -local storage function gets called immediately on page load
Create a function that shows the curent time with an if statement that shows past, present, or future
    -use variable for currentHour = moment(.hour)
    -Create a for loop and initialize athe first hour of timeblock and follow it with an if statement 
    -condition: if currentHour < hour in timeblock, then color code input field with style gray
                else if currentHour = hour in timeblock, then color code input field with style red 
                else color with style code green
